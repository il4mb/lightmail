4. **Update Documentation:** Keep documentation current with code changes

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/il4mb/lightmail.git

# 3. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# 4. Make changes and test
make debug
make test

# 5. Commit changes
git commit -m "Add your feature"

# 6. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature

# 7. Create a Pull Request
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

- [ ] Memory leaks in connection handling
- [ ] Incomplete IMAP command implementation
- [ ] Limited error handling
- [ ] No SSL/TLS support yet
- [ ] Basic authentication only

## 🔍 Testing

Run the included unit tests (fast, self-contained):

```bash
# Run unit tests
./tests/run_tests.sh
```

Benchmarks (manual): see `bench/append_bench.sh` and `bench/fetch_bench.sh` for instructions and simple helper scripts.

## 🔍 Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
make test-unit

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Run full test suite
make test-all

# Test specific IMAP commands
make test-imap
```

## 📊 Database Schema

The planned MySQL schema includes:

```sql
-- Users and authentication
CREATE TABLE users (...);

-- Mailboxes and hierarchy
CREATE TABLE mailboxes (...);

-- Message metadata
CREATE TABLE messages (...);

-- Message bodies (S3 references)
CREATE TABLE message_bodies (...);

-- Sessions and connections
CREATE TABLE sessions (...);
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

**⚠️ Important:** This software is not yet secure for production use.

- [ ] Implement proper password hashing
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Implement connection encryption
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Security audit needed

## 📈 Performance Goals

- Target: 10,000 concurrent connections
- Message retrieval: < 50ms for 10MB messages
- Search operations: < 100ms for 1M messages
- Memory usage: < 50MB base + 1MB per connection

## 📚 Documentation Status

- [ ] API Documentation: Not started
- [ ] User Guide: Not started
- [ ] Admin Guide: Not started
- [ ] Deployment Guide: Not started
- [ ] Developer Guide: Partial
